//! Applying an incoming op, and the rule that decides whether it may.

/// Whether an incoming edit supersedes the stored one for a field.
///
/// Timestamps are RFC3339 UTC with a fixed number of digits, canonicalized upstream before
/// reaching here, so a lexical comparison is also a chronological one and no parsing is needed.
/// Equal timestamps are broken by `device_id`: the incoming edit wins if its device_id is
/// lexically greater. This tiebreaker remains consistent across all devices because `device_id`
/// is expected to be unique among concurrently active writers, a precondition that is the
/// client's responsibility to maintain.
///
/// If two devices violate this precondition and use the same device_id, a full tie can occur:
/// equal timestamps and identical device_id mean neither op wins in the comparison. The
/// first-arriving op persists in this case. Convergence is still guaranteed because
/// `GET /sync/pull` orders all ops by the server's `changes.seq`, a monotonic sequence that
/// every client observes identically. All participants independently walk this sequence in the
/// same order, so they each independently keep the same first-arriving op in a tie. An op
/// identical to the stored one does not win, so a replay is a no-op rather than a rewrite.
